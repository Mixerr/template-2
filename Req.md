2.5 Localization
Language Support:
Primary Languages:
The platform will be available in LT (Lithuanian) and EN (English).
Content Translation:
All user interfaces, educational content, and instructional texts must be provided in both languages.
Language Switching:
An intuitive language selector will be present on every page to allow users to toggle between LT and EN seamlessly.
Future-Proofing:
The localization framework should allow for the easy addition of new languages.
Fallback Mechanism:
If a translation for a particular piece of content is missing, the platform should default to the primary language (e.g., English).
